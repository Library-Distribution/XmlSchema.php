# XmlSchema.php
A small lib that can read XML schema definitions (XSD), take the PHP data (mostly an array) you pass
it, and spit out XML representing the data according to the schema.

This lib is not at all complete. It won't necessarily ever become complete either. This is written as
an experiment, to be used with [Library-Distribution/ALD-API](https://github.com/Library-Distribution/ALD-API),
to ease output of valid XML from the API. As soon as that works, further work on this lib is to be delayed.
